A demo project to showcase different technologies and how they work together.
The ultimate goal is to have a full-stack, production-ready application.

You can use the `setup.sh` script to run it locally.

The goal for this project is to be a "domain driven" starter that will help you
bootstrap a new application in seconds and just work your business logic instead of all the bootstrapping.

Inspired by [ts-app](https://github.com/lukeautry/ts-app), this project aims to be a little lighter version of that project, with clearer separation of frontend and backend code. And a bigger focus and metrics and monitoring.

## Where do I start

You can start by running:

```sh
sh ./setup.sh
```

You can also start the project locally:

```sh
yarn dev
```

After you finish you can clean your setup with:

```sh
sh ./clean.sh
```

## Status

Work in progress.

## System Requirements

    - Generates Express Routes from TypeScript controllers
    - Generates [OpenAPI ("Swagger")](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about) specification, enabling automatic documentation
  - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) as a local development database
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as RDBMS
    - [TypeORM](http://typeorm.io) for code-first database migrations and ORM queries
  - [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching

- Developer environment

  - [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) for non-Node.js project dependencies
  - VSCode, eslint and prettier for a consistent development experience
  - A setup script `setup.sh` to help you get started in a guided way.

- Frontend

  - [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
